HARDINFO(1)                 User Commands                 HARDINFO(1)

NAME
       HardInfo - System profiler and benchmark for Linux systems.

USAGE
       hardinfo [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Is  a  system  profiler  and benchmark for Linux systems, that
       gathers information about the hardware and  operating  system,
       performs  benchmarks,  and generates reports.  The information
       gathered is presented on an simple and intuitive GUI.

       Information is grouped in four main groups: Computer, Devices,
       Network, and Benchmarks.

       The  Computer  group  contains  mostly information about basic
       software.  This includes but is  not  limited  to  information
       about the operating system (kernel version, C library, distri‐
       bution, etc.), kernel modules, locale information,  filesystem
       usage, users/groups, and development tools.

       The  Devices group contains information about the hardware, as
       detected by the operating system.  Hardinfo  is  incapable  of
       detecting hardware by itself, it merely lists what the operat‐
       ing system was able to find.   This  includes,  but  does  not
       limit  to,  information  about  the processor (including cache
       layout, known bugs, and feature flags with their explanation),
       devices  (such  as  USB,  PCI, and Input devices), among other
       things.

       The Network group lists information about network  interfaces,
       routing  table, DNS servers, and other networking-related top‐
       ics.

       The Benchmarks group allow  performing  simple  benchmarks  to
       test  CPU and FPU capabilities, as well as some of the graphi‐
       cal user interface capabilities as  well.   In  previous  ver‐
       sions, it was possible to send the benchmark results to a cen‐
       tral server, so it was possible to compare the benchmarks with
       other Hardinfo users; this service has been deactivated in the
       mean time.

       Reports can be generated either by invoking Hardinfo with spe‐
       cial  command-line  parameters (see below), or by clicking the
       "Generate Report" button in the GUI.  Reports can  be  custom‐
       ized  in  the  GUI and saved in either HTML or plain text for‐
       mats.

       -b, --run-benchmark
              run benchmark; requires benchmark.so to be loaded

       -l, --list-modules
              lists modules

       -m, --load-module
              specify module to load

       -a, --autoload-deps
